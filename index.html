            <p>Hello! My name is Wei Ling, and I'm originally from Taiwan.<br> 
              I moved to the United States three years ago<br>
              and am a proud mother of an 18-month-old toddler.<br>
              This is my first time exploring web programming,<br> 
              and I'm excited to dive into this new journey and <br>
              expand my skills in web development.<br>
              I look forward to learning and growing in this field!</p>
